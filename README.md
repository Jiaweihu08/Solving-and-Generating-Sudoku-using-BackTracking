# Solving and Generating Sudoku Puzzles using Backtracking

## Objective:
## - Visualize Backtracking algorithm by solving sudoku puzzles

## Results:
### - Implemented Backtracking to solve 9x9 Sudoku puzzles

### - Generated valid random sudoku puzzles with the following implementation:
#### 1. Random grid initialization
#### 2. Solve the grid using backtracking to obtain a completed puzzle
#### 3. Randomly pick a spot and check wether the assigned value is the only possible one, adn remove the value if it's the case
#### 4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the desired number of empty spots is reached
